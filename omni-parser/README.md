# omni-parser

Autogenerated from `Omni.cf` using BNFC. 

Run `make parser` to generate it.

## Source spans

> NOTE: Source spans (with both start and end points) are not currently implemented in BNFC master. This parser needs to be generated specifically with BNFC compiled from [this fork](https://github.com/aabounegm/bnfc/tree/position-range), which implements support for source spans.
